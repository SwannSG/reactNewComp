#How to manage CSS for ReactJS components ?

##What we have tried

Have tried all inline styles using Radium. Very specific so no global class naming issues. Everything is self-contained so it is possible to see what is going on in one place. Some CSS properties are not supported and then external CSS file is required. Does create a lot of verbosity in the DOM. Overall seems to work well, but there is something curiously unsatisfactory about this approach. Almost like there MUST be a better approach.

##PostCSS Discovered

After investigating further, *postCSS* regularly came up as a tool to enhance CSS capability. So our new approach is to test with this new capability. Key capabilities through plug-ins are:

1. Class names that won't collide.
2. Variables
3. Composition

##Class names (that won't collide)

Long, collison free, class names are autogenerated, and there is an easy mechanism to link the JSX component className to the postCSS generated class name. So we can have crisp class names inside the component. Class names are a real pain. Do we stick with semantic names, or do we just use super short names like 'a', 'b', 'c'. Perhaps each component has a natural flow that lends itself to semantic class names.

Essentially we have content, defined in JSX, with a className. This provides the bridge to the CSS world. One of our new design goals is to keep the JSX as uncluttered and crisp as possible. That means none of the bootstrap like *class="btn btn-default"* class names. I have seen people refer to these as Utility Classes. So no Utility Classes in the JSX/ html world. We can avoid this because we have now have CSS Composition available to us.

For now we are going to attempt using non-semantic classnames. So ultra short, no semantic meaning, and simply a label as a bridge to the CSS world. By attaching no semantic meaning to the label (classname) we don't have to think about the name. This may turn out to be a teriible idea -  we will see.

##Non-Semantic class names

We define the JSX component with the minimum html possible. Each div gets a classname starting at 'a'. Then we take that blueprint and setup the styling. We hope the minimum html provides sufficient hooks for all styling to take place.

##Composition and Utility Classes

Utility classes are very helpful. They provide nice names that describe what they do. But now we can keep them in the CSS world where they belong. No overflow into the html. We can do that because of composability.

'''javascript
.someClass: {
    composes: btn from "./someUtilityClassFile.css";
}
'''
